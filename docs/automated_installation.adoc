== Automated installation process
The `install-gns3.sh` script will automate most of the installation process.

== Features

=== Error checking

The script checks for errors along the way. If one of the steps did not succeed the script will be ended and the user notified.

Example:

```
yay -S vpcs --noconfirm # <1>
cd "$HOME" || exit
check_for_vpcs=$(type vpcs | grep -c "vpcs is /usr/bin/vpcs") # <2>
if [[ "$check_for_vpcs" -lt 1 ]];  then # <3>
  echo -e "${On_Red}
  Unable to find VPCS after isntall....
  Aborting the script${Color_Off}"
  exit
fi
```
<1> Installing VPCS from AUR
<2> Define a variable to check for VPCS installation. If installed, grep value will be > 1. There are many ways to do this, I've chosed this way for no particular reason.
<3> If the value returned by the $check_for_vpcs is less then 1, notify the user and end the script.


== Usage

The script aims to provide a complete and functioning GNS3 experience. Using the script is simple. Recommended usage is to clone the repo and to execute the script via bash.

```
git clone https://github.com/SirToffski/Arch-GNS3-Helper.git
cd Arch-GNS3-Helper/
bash install-gns3.sh
```
